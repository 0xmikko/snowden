### Problem:
Share your opinion and got a ban from Facebook? Authorities try to block all your posts? Publishing your opposite opinion could be a reason for criminal prosecution? Today social networks and authorities try to control people and block free opinions share. We need a robust system which could protect persons who share information and make it’s visible for selected people and pointless for others.
 
### Solution:
Snowden is a Google Chrome extension which helps you to share your thoughts for selected list of people (no limit how much they are) using NuCypher Technology. You could simply encrypt your message into human readble text and nobody could claim you. Only selected peopls could read “between lines” and see what you want to share.

Extension provides two basic functions:
 
#### Encrypt posts
Simply share your thoughts via public networks, just insert your text into extension ang get a translated text (it’s human readable and neutral)

#### Decrypt messages
When you read any site, system automatically finds encrypted text and show you it if it’s found a new one.
